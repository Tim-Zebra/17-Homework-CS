      <li> Pseudocode: I want a month to match if the first M is equal to 0-1 and the last M is equal to 0-9 only when the first digit is 0, else the second digit should only equal 0-2 . We want to group the MM.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The first M:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I want it to equal 0 or 1. The hints that I should be using an OR operator. M will be used to denote the M not yet solved for</li>

          <li>The second M:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I want it to equal 1-9 if the month is a single number (09) OR 0-2 (to account for oct, nov, dec.)</li>

            <li>Lets take care of whatever is being used to separate the dates, we will account for the standard MM.DD.YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, and MM/DD/YYYY. We need for these separators to 1. not perform a function (such as ' . ' wildcard) and have them be 'literal'</li>
